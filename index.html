	<p>To those who don't listen to rap and don't know who Kendrick Lamar is, he's one of the most renown rappers on the hip-hop scene currently. I first saw Lamar in concert about four years ago, just after he released his first album and before he catapulted to stardom. I've enjoyed his music ever since and I hope you do too.</p>
